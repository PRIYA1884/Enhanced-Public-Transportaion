# Project Design Document: Enhancing Public Transportation through Data Analysis
## Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking
### Project Definition
**Project Title:** Enhancing Public Transportation through Data Analysis
**Project Objective:** The project aims to analyze public transportation data to assess service 
efficiency, on-time performance, and passenger feedback, ultimately supporting transportation 
improvement initiatives and enhancing the overall public transportation experience.

Design Thinking
In this phase, we will outline the key components of the project, including analysis objectives, data 
collection strategies, visualization plans using IBM Cognos, and the integration of code for data 
analysis. The design thinking process ensures a structured and holistic approach to problem-solving.

 Analysis Objectives
1. **Assess On-Time Performance:** The primary objective is to evaluate the punctuality of public 
transportation services. This involves analyzing historical data on scheduled departure and arrival 
times versus actual times.
2. **Measure Passenger Satisfaction:** We aim to gauge passenger satisfaction through surveys and 
feedback data. This includes sentiment analysis of customer reviews and ratings.
3. **Evaluate Service Efficiency:** To determine the efficiency of transportation services, we will 
examine data related to route optimization, fuel consumption, and operational costs.

Data Collection
1. **Schedules and Real-Time Updates:** We will gather historical schedules and real-time updates 
from transportation agencies. This data will provide insights into planned versus actual service 
timings and potential delays.
2. **Passenger Feedback:** To measure passenger satisfaction, we will collect feedback through 
online surveys, customer service logs, and social media sentiment analysis.
3. **Operational Data:** Information regarding fuel consumption, maintenance schedules, and 
operational costs will be obtained from transportation agencies and maintenance records.

 Visualization Strategy
1. **Dashboard Creation:** Utilizing IBM Cognos, we will design interactive dashboards that present 
key performance indicators (KPIs) related to on-time performance, passenger satisfaction, and 
service efficiency. These dashboards will enable stakeholders to easily grasp trends and make 
informed decisions.
2. **Custom Reports:** Alongside dashboards, custom reports will be generated to provide in-depth 
insights and trends. These reports will cater to the specific needs of different stakeholders, such as 
transportation authorities, management teams, and maintenance crews.
3. **Geospatial Visualization:** Geospatial data will be used to visualize route performance, helping 
identify areas with frequent delays or service issues. Heatmaps and spatial analysis will be employed 
for this purpose.

 Code Integration
1. **Data Cleaning:** Code will be used to clean and preprocess the collected data. This includes 
handling missing values, data normalization, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Transformation:** Complex data transformations, such as aggregating passenger feedback 
scores, calculating performance metrics, and geospatial data transformations, will be implemented 
using code.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Advanced statistical analysis, including regression analysis to identify 
factors affecting on-time performance, and clustering for customer segmentation, will be carried out 
through code-based approaches.



CONCLUSION:
In this initial phase of the project, I have defined the problem statement and outlined our design 
thinking approach. By setting clear analysis objectives, specifying data sources and collection 
methods, planning visualization strategies, and considering code integration, we are well-prepared to 
proceed to the next phases of data gathering, analysis, and reporting. This structured approach will 
ensure that our project results in actionable insights to enhance the public transportation 
experience
